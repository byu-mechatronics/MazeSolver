# Maze Solver
This is the starter code for the Winter 2019 club project. 
Teams are encouraged to use this code as a starting point, and then modify and improve upon it.  

This Arduino code is for DC motors controlled by an H bridge. It assumes there are three ultrasonic sensors placed on the front, left, and right of the robot.
